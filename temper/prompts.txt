Hi there, I'm working on a novel machine learning architecture with you, and I need your help coming up with high impact directions to improve the model, refactoring the model, and philosophizing about high level architectural decisions.  Can i share the relevant model, train file, and a readme with a manifesto, so that you can scan them and understand the model?
