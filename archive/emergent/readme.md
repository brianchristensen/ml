### 🔧 Architecture Manifesto

Rewrites are the primitive operation of intelligence.

It’s not weights.
It’s not tokens.
It’s not even layers.

It’s the ability to rewrite internal structure in response to experience.

🧬 It’s Rewrites All the Way Down

DNA: mutates, recombines, gets rewritten.

Immune system: rewrites itself constantly to detect new pathogens.

Neuroplasticity: synapses restructure, entire circuits reconfigure.

Culture, language, reasoning: abstract rewrites over symbolic space.

Planning and imagination: predictive rewrites of mental trajectories.

Every level of the stack is a rewriting machine, operating under local rules and global pressure.

And most importantly:

The structures that survive rewrites long enough become higher-level abstractions.
(i.e., emergent hierarchy is not designed — it's stabilized.)

We are building a rewriting substrate.

Something that can:

Rewrite its own computation graph (via operators + routing)

Stabilize emergent patterns (via learning + task feedback)

Climb the hierarchy — from perception to inference to reasoning

Temper (n.): A localized, adaptive unit of computation that modifies its own functional behavior in response to external context or internal pressure. Unlike fixed functions, tempers exhibit plasticity — not just computing, but rewriting the terms of computation.
