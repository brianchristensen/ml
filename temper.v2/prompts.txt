Hi there, I'm working on a novel machine learning architecture with you, and I need your help coming up with high impact directions to improve the model, refactoring the model, and philosophizing about high level architectural decisions that move us in the direction of true novelty.  Make sure that any code you implement for me is GPU native.  Can i share the relevant model, train file, and a readme with a manifesto, so that you can scan them and understand the model?

I'm having trouble debugging some issues in a novel deep learning architecture im building.  I've attached a manifesto, so that you understand the high level goals, and I've also attached the current model and trainer files for you to inspect.  Let me know if you understand what we are working on, and then I will share details of the current issues.
